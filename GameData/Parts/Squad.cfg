    @description = By exploiting the 'natural' decay of radiological isotopes, electrical power can be generated for prolonged durationsâ€”indeed, indefinitely, but the output tends to fall off over time. Accountants have also noted that different 'hot rocks' are hotter or cooler than others and tend to cool down a different rates, with the two aspects not necessarily being related.
